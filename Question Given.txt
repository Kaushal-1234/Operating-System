Project -----Producer_Consumer _Problem


We presented a semaphore-based solution to the producer– consumer problem using a bounded buffer. In this project, we have to design a programming solution to the bounded-buffer problem using the producer and consumer processes . The solution presented in Section5.7.1usesthreesemaphores:emptyandfull,whichcountthenumber of empty and full slots in the buffer, and mutex, which is a binary (or mutualexclusion) semaphore that protects the actual insertion or removal of items in the buffer. For this project, we will use standard counting semaphores for empty and full and a  mutex lock,rather than a  binary  semaphore,to  represent mutex.The  producer and  consumer—running  as separate  threads—will  move items  to  and from a  buffer that is synchronized with the empty,full,and  mutex structures. We can solve this problem using either Pthreads or Monitor concept,or by the mutex lock.
